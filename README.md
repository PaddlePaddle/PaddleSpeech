*DeepSpeech* is an open-source implementation of end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition engine, with [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle) platform. Our vision is to empower both industrial application and academic research on speech recognition, via an easy-to-use, efficient, samller and scalable implementation, including training, inference & testing module, and deployment.
