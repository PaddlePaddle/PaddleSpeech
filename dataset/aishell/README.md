This Open Source Mandarin Speech Corpus, AISHELL-ASR0009-OS1, is 178 hours long. It is a part of AISHELL-ASR0009, of which utterance contains 11 domains, including smart home, autonomous driving, and industrial production. The whole recording was put in quiet indoor environment, using 3 different devices at the same time: high fidelity microphone (44.1kHz, 16-bit,); Android-system mobile phone (16kHz, 16-bit), iOS-system mobile phone (16kHz, 16-bit). Audios in high fidelity were re-sampled to 16kHz to build AISHELL- ASR0009-OS1. 400 speakers from different accent areas in China were invited to participate in the recording. The manual transcription accuracy rate is above 95%, through professional speech annotation and strict quality inspection. The corpus is divided into training, development and testing sets.
