The AMI Meeting Corpus is a multi-modal data set consisting of 100 hours of meeting recordings. For a gentle introduction to the corpus, see the [corpus overview](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus/overview.shtml). To access the data, follow the directions given [there](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/download). Around two-thirds of the data has been elicited using a scenario in which the participants play different roles in a design team, taking a design project from kick-off to completion over the course of a day. The rest consists of naturally occurring meetings in a range of domains. 

Detailed information can be found in the [documentation section](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus/datasets.shtml).
