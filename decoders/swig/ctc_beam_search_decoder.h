/* CTC Beam Search Decoder

 * Parameters:
 *     probs_seq: 2-D vector that each element is a vector of probabilities
 *               over vocabulary of one time step.
 *     vocabulary: A vector of vocabulary.
 *     beam_size: The width of beam search.
 *     cutoff_prob: Cutoff probability for pruning.
 *     cutoff_top_n: Cutoff number for pruning.
 *     ext_scorer: External scorer to evaluate a prefix, which consists of
 *                 n-gram language model scoring and word insertion term.
 *                 Default null, decoding the input sample without scorer.
 * Return:
 *     A vector that each element is a pair of score  and decoding result,
 *     in desending order.

/* CTC Beam Search Decoder for batch data

 * Parameters:

 *     vocabulary: A vector of vocabulary.
 *     beam_size: The width of beam search.
 *     num_processes: Number of threads for beam search.

 * Return:
 *     A 2-D vector that each element is a vector of beam search decoding
 *     result for one audio sample.
