# Metaverse

## Introduction
This demo is an implementation to let a celebrity in an image "speak". With the composition of PaddleSpeech and PaddleGAN, we integrate the installation and the specific modules in a single shell script. 

## How to use our code

You can make your favorite person say the specified content with the `TTS` mudule of `PaddleSpeech` and `PaddleGAN`, and construct your own virtual human.

First, locate the directory you would like to run our code, and set the environment variants. 
```shell
./path.sh
```
Download the celebrity image in the current directory, in our case we use `Lamarr.png`.

Second, run `run.sh` to complete all the essential procedures, including the installation.  

```shell
./run.sh
```
If you would like to try your own image, please replace the image name in the shell script.

The result has shown on our notebook[]().
