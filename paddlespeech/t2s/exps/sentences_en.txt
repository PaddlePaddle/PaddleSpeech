001 Life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.
002 With great power there must come great responsibility.
003 To be or not to be, that’s a question.
004 A man can be destroyed but not defeated
005 Do not, for one repulse, give up the purpose that you resolved to effort.
006 Death is just a part of life, something we're all destined to do.
007 I think it's hard winning a war with words. 
008 Don’t argue with the people of strong determination, because they may change the fact!
009 Love you three thousand times.
